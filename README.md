This XML file is part of the UPPAAL model that I developed while working as a Researcher on the PERFORMINGRAIL project in 2022. 

UPPAAL is an integrated tool environment for modeling, validation and verification of real-time systems modeled as networks of timed automata, extended with data types (bounded integers, arrays etc.). [Wikipedia]

The model is a timed automaton in which the main entity is a train represented in a loss of communication scenario with the central control system. It was developed in order to perform real-time verification of security properties that, if verified, would allow the train to avoid critical situations despite the impossibility of communicating with the central system.
